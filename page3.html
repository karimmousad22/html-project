            <dt><b>Groovy</b></dt>
            <dd>Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-typing and static compilation capabilities, for the Java platform aimed at improving developer productivity. It uses a curly-bracket syntax similar to Java’s and supports closures, multiline strings, and expressions embedded in strings.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Dart</b></dt>
            <dd>Dart is a client-optimized language for apps on multiple platforms. It is developed by Google and can be compiled to the ARM and x86 architectures for mobile use or transpiled to JavaScript for browser applications.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Assembly Language</b></dt>
            <dd>Assembly language can be converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler like NASM, MASM, etc. This programming language is designed for a computer or other programmable device specific to particular computer architecture.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>PowerShell</b></dt>
            <dd>PowerShell provides full access to COM and WMI, enabling administrators to perform administrative tasks on both local and remote Windows systems as well as WS-Management and CIM enabling management of remote Linux systems and network devices. It has a rich expression parser and a fully developed scripting language.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Julia</b></dt>
            <dd>A general-purpose language and can be used to write any application, Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language. Many of its features are well-suited for numerical analysis and computational science.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Scratch</b></dt>
            <dd>Scratch is used to create interactive stories, games, and animations. While the Scratch language is fairly easy to use, fun, and addictive, the language is popular for two main reasons, its community and how Scratch encourages kids to learn then take risks to adapt what they’ve done.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>COBOL</b></dt>
            <dd>COBOL is used for writing application programs like those in the defense domain, insurance, etc., which require huge data processing. Massive COBOL codebases are still in use around the world, many of them running almost exactly as they were when first created.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Fortran</b></dt>
            <dd>Fortran comprises of a lineage of versions, each of which evolved to add extensions to the language while usually retaining compatibility with prior versions. It is extensively used in numerical, scientific computing, and has a strong user base with scientific programmers. The language is also used in organizations such as weather forecasters, financial trading, and in engineering simulations.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>ABAP</b></dt>
            <dd>Stands for Advanced Business Application Programming, ABAP is a high-level programming language created by the German software company SAP SE. It is extracted from the base computing languages Java, C, C++ and Python, and is currently positioned, alongside Java.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Scheme</b></dt>
            <dd>Scheme language supports operations on structured data such as strings, lists, and vectors, as well as operations on more traditional data such as numbers and characters. It has been employed to write text editors, optimizing compilers, operating systems, graphics packages, expert systems, numerical applications, financial analysis packages, virtual reality systems, and practically every other type of application imaginable.</dd>
