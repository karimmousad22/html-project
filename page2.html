            <dt><b>C++</b></dt>
            <dd>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that can be used to develop operating systems, browsers, games, and more. It supports different ways of programming like procedural, object-oriented, functional, and so on. This makes C++ powerful as well as flexible.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>R</b></dt>
            <dd>R is one of the most popular languages commonly used in statistical computing, data analytics and scientific research. It is used by statisticians, data analysts, researchers and marketers to retrieve, clean, assess, visualize and present data. Owing to its expressive syntax and easy-to-use interface, R has grown in popularity in recent years.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Objective-C</b></dt>
            <dd>Objective-C is an object-oriented language based upon the standard programming language C. It is designed to give C full object-oriented programming capabilities, and to do so in a simple and straightforward way. Objective-C is the main programming language used by Apple for the OS X and iOS operating systems and their respective APIs, Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>SQL</b></dt>
            <dd>SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases. All the Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Arduino</b></dt>
            <dd>Arduino programming language is based upon the Wiring development platform, which in turn is based upon Processing. It is basically a framework built on top of C++. There are various models of Arduino boards, as well as a whole variety of Arduino-compatible clone products, such as GSTduino, Freaduino, or CraftDuino. Their basic structure is rather similar.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>MATLAB</b></dt>
            <dd>MATLAB is used widely in the Computer Vision and Image processing industry. It started out as a matrix programming language where linear algebra programming was simple. MATLAB is Ideal for developing scientific research applications. Matlab Coder allows converting code for use in other programming languages, such as C++, Java, and Python.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Rust</b></dt>
            <dd>Rust has valuable built-in documentation and features helpful error messages. It offers speed and security, without sacrificing performance. Developers use Rust to create a wide range of new software applications, such as game engines, operating systems, file systems, browser components and simulation engines for virtual reality.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>TypeScript</b></dt>
            <dd>TypeScript is an open-source language that builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions. Types provide a way to define the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that a userâ€™s code is working correctly.</dd>
