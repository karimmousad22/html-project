            <dt><b>Shell</b></dt>
            <dd>A shell program, sometimes referred to as a shell script, is simply a program constructed of shell commands. Designed to be run by the Unix shell, a command-line interpreter, the language may be simple and encompass just a few shell commands, or it may be very complex and comprises thousands of shell commands.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Prolog</b></dt>
            <dd>As a logic programming language, Prolog has an important role in artificial intelligence. Unlike other languages, Prolog is intended primarily as a declarative programming language. In prolog, logic is expressed as relations called Facts and Rules.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>VBScript</b></dt>
            <dd>VBScript is the primary scripting language for Quick Test Professional (QTP), which is a test automation tool. It uses the Component Object Model to access elements of the environment within which it is running. For example, the FileSystemObject (FSO) is used to create, read, update and delete files.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Haskell</b></dt>
            <dd>As logicians create models to describe and define human reasoning, for example, problems in mathematics, computer science, and philosophy, Haskellâ€™s main work was in combinatory logic, a notation designed to eliminate the need for variables in mathematical logic. It is typically used in academia and industry.

            <br>
            <dt><b>Delphi</b></dt>
            <dd>Delphi uses the Object Pascal programming language. It is an integrated development environment (IDE) for rapid application development of desktop, mobile, web, and console software, currently developed and maintained by Embarcadero Technologies.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Hack</b></dt>
            <dd>The Hack programming language has been released for HHVM (HipHop Virtual Machine), created by Facebook as a dialect of PHP. Hack reconciles the fast development cycle of PHP with the discipline provided by static typing, while adding many features commonly found in other modern programming languages.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Pascal</b></dt>
            <dd>Pascal was developed for teaching programming as a systematic discipline and to develop reliable and efficient programs. It is an Algol-based language and involves many constructs of Algol. Pascal offers several data types and programming structures. It is easy to understand and maintain Pascal programs.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Ada</b></dt>
            <dd>Ada improves code safety and maintainability by using the compiler to find errors in favor of runtime errors. It was designed to be a single language, capable of running on all of those embedded systems, which offered the same or better level of performance and reliability.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Lua</b></dt>
            <dd>Lua is used for all sorts of applications, from games to web applications and image processing. To run Lua programs on the computer, users will need a standalone Lua interpreter and perhaps some additional Lua libraries.</dd>
            <br>
            <dt><b>Visual Basic</b></dt>
            <dd>Developed by Microsoft, Visual Basic is a third-generation event-driven programming language known for its Component Object Model (COM) programming model. Visual Basic was derived from BASIC and enables the rapid application development (RAD) of GUI applications, access to databases using Data Access Objects, Remote Data Objects, or ActiveX Data Objects, and creation of ActiveX controls and objects.</dd>
